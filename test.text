describe.only
describe.skip  also be used globally

// file convention
file with .test.js or test.jsx suffix
files with .specs.js or specs.tsx suffix
files with .js or .tsx in _test_ folders.

recommendation  is to always put your test nest to the code they are testing so that relative
imports are shorter
